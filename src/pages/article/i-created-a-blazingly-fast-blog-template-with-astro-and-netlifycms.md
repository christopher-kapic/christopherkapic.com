This article was written and published on my [blog](https://christopherkapic.com). I _did not_ interact with Medium or dev.to except to check that it was republished correctly.

## What is [Astro Devblog](https://astro-devblog.netlify.app/)?
### A serverless (JAMstack) blog template intended to be deployed to Netlify which republishes articles to [Medium](https://medium.com/@christopherkapic) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/christopherkapic).

Read about how to deploy the template for yourself [here](https://astro-devblog.netlify.app/article/how-to-use-astro-devblog), or see [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/8c7_vX3XPDc). Or, better yet, dive into the [git repo](https://github.com/christopher-kapic/astro-devblog).

## Why Astro?
### [Astro](https://astro.build/) is the hot new kid on the block, with compelling features like zero JavaScript by default and the Islands architecture.

Previously, I was using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) for my blog. However, Astro offers several advantages, including...
- Islands architecture allows me to incorporate UI frameworks/libraries when necessary or helpful
- SSR futureproofs my stack

I have not yet rebuilt all of the features associated with my old blog, but I am optimistic that Astro is a good choice for my blog's future. In the near future, I will share the aspects of Astro that I enjoyed, as well as the pieces with which I found frustration. If you're interested in that, consider following me on [Dev](https://dev.to/christopherkapic), [Medium](https://medium.com/@christopherkapic), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuXgDzDJhNAwvzvc62GnYwA), and/or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kapicode).

Thanks for reading!
